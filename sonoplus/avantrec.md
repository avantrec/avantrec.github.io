# About Avantrec

Avantrec Ltd is a newly-formed small company based in Bristol in the UK. SonoPlus is one element of our initial portfolio of development and consulting projects.

We love our Sonos systems -- we have around twenty Sonos devices. The idea for SonoPlus emerged from some fun personal projects we've undertaken to address functional gaps in the Sonos experience. These were rather successful, so we decided to try packaging and 'productising' the improvements we've worked on, to make them available to everyone without needing technical know-how.
