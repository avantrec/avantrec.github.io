# About Avantrec

Avantrec Ltd is a newly-formed small company based in Bristol in the UK. SonoPlus is one element of our initial portfolio of development and consulting projects.

We love our Sonos systems, and we have around twenty Sonos devices of various types. The idea for SonoPlus emerged from some fun personal projects we've undertaken to make Sonos even better. These projects worked out satisfyingly well, so we decided to experiment with packaging and simplifying them, to make them available to everyone without needing technical know-how.
