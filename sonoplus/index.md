# About SonoPlus

**SonoPlus enhances Sonos audio systems.**

The SonoPlus is a preconfigured Raspberry Pi that you simply connect to your network using an Ethernet cable. No further setup or configuration is required.

## 1: AirPlay for older Sonos systems

SonoPlus adds AirPlay capability to all non-AirPlay Sonos speakers and devices.

Once your SonoPlus is connected it will automatically find all your Sonos players, which will then appear as AirPlay speakers for your Apple devices. **One** SonoPlus will serve all of your players, and handle multiple AirPlay streams simultaneously.

## 2: Easy, secure hosting of local music libraries

The **[Instant Music Library]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sonoplus/instantlibrary.md %})** feature provides a very simple and secure way of setting up a NAS (network-attached storage) capability, which meets the specific requirements of Sonos music libraries.

## 3: Automatic software updates

SonoPlus is automatically kept up-to-date and secure, and its functionality will grow over time to include new features to enhance your Sonos experience.
