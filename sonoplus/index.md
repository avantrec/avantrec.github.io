# About SonoPlus

**SonoPlus adds AirPlay capability to all Sonos players that don't support AirPlay 2**

**** Also ... New Feature: [Instant Music Library]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sonoplus/instantlibrary.md %}) ****

SonoPlus is delivered as a preconfigured Raspberry Pi computer that you simply connect to your network using an Ethernet cable.

Once your SonoPlus is connected, all Sonos players will appear as AirPlay speakers, and work just like any other AirPlay devices. No setup or configuration of your SonoPlus is required. One SonoPlus will serve all of your players, and it can handle multiple simultaneous streams.

Automatic software updates mean that your SonoPlus is kept up-to-date and secure, and its functionality will grow over time to include new features to enhance the Sonos experience. 

SonoPlus is currently in beta test and is not yet on general sale. Learn more at the [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sonoplus/faq.md %}) and [Beta]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sonoplus/beta.md %}) pages.
