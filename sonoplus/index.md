# Avantrec SonoPlus

**SonoPlus adds direct AirPlay capability for all older Sonos players.**

SonoPlus is delivered as a preconfigured Raspberry Pi computer that you simply connect to your router using an Ethernet cable.

Once your SonoPlus is connected, all Sonos players will appear as AirPlay targets, and work just like any other AirPlay speakers. No setup or configuration of the SonoPlus is required.

Automatic software updates mean that your SonoPlus is kept up-to-date and secure, and its functionality is expected to grow over time to include new features.

SonoPlus is currently in Beta test and is not yet for sale. Learn more at the [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sonoplus-faq/index.md %}) and [Beta]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sonoplus-beta/index.md %}) pages.
