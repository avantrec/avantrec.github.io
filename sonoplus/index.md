# SonoPlus

**SonoPlus adds AirPlay capability to all your older Sonos players.**

SonoPlus is delivered as a preconfigured Raspberry Pi computer that you simply connect to your network using an Ethernet cable.

Once your SonoPlus is connected, all Sonos players will appear as AirPlay speakers, and work just like any other AirPlay devices. No setup or configuration of your SonoPlus is required.

Automatic software updates mean that your SonoPlus is kept up-to-date and secure, and its functionality will grow over time to include new features to enhance the Sonos experience. 

SonoPlus is currently in Beta test and is not yet for sale. Learn more at the [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sonoplus-faq/index.md %}) and [Beta]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sonoplus-beta/index.md %}) pages.
