# About Avantrec

Avantrec Ltd is a newly-formed small company based in Bristol in the UK. SonoPlus is one member of our initial portfolio of development and consulting projects.

SonoPlus emerged from our efforts to address gaps in the Sonos experience for our own Sonos speakers and devices, and we're very happy with the progress we've made. SonoPlus packages and  'productises' the improvements we've worked on, to make them available to everyone without needing technical know-how.
