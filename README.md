# Avantrec Ltd Website

This site is auto-generated by GitHub using Jekyll. I followed the tutorial at http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages. The site is reached at https://avantrec.github.io.

For local site builds use `jekyll build`, and to inspect the site use `jekyll serve`.

SonoPlus blog posts go in /_sonoplus-posts, using the canonical filename format. See https://ben.balter.com/2015/02/20/jekyll-collections/ for a description of the collections mechanism.
