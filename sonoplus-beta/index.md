# SonoPlus Beta Trial

The SonoPlus concept and device are currently in limited Beta test, with a small number of units being field-tested. The purpose of the beta test is to assess how well SonoPlus works in a variety of user environments, and to gather feedback about the product concept.

If you're interested in participating in the Beta test, please get in touch by email at <a href="mailto:avantrec.ltd@gmail.com">avantrec.ltd@gmail.com</a> and include the following information:

1. The country in which your SonoPlus will be used
2. Which Sonos speakers or other Sonos devices you have
3. Which Apple devices you have from which you use (or will use) AirPlay
4. Which audio sources (e.g., podcasts, local music on phone, BBC Sounds) you'll use with AirPlay and Sonos

SonoPlus Beta units are currently being supplied free of charge to suitable participants, but we reserve the right to request the return of the units at the end of the trial (after several months of usage).

If you participate in the Beta test you agree to report back on your experiences with the SonoPlus, when this information is requested. You also agree that Avantrec Ltd can remotely access your SonoPlus device, for the sole purposes of monitoring its performance (including troubleshooting) and updating its software. **No** information of any kind is shared with third parties.

Thanks for your interest in the SonoPlus Beta trial.
