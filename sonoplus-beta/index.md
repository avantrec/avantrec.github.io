# SonoPlus Beta Trial

The SonoPlus concept and device are currently in limited Beta test, with a small number of units being field-tested. The purpose of the beta test is to assess how well SonoPlus works in a variety of user environments, and to gather feedback about the product concept.

If you're interested in participating in the Beta test, please get in touch by email at <a href="mailto:avantrec.ltd@gmail.com">avantrec.ltd@gmail.com</a> and include the following information:

1. Which Sonos speakers/players you have
2. Which Apple devices you have from which you use (or will use) AirPlay
3. Which audio sources (e.g., podcasts, local music on phone, BBC Sounds) you'll use with AirPlay and Sonos

If you're selected for the trial, a SonoPlus unit will be sent to you free of charge. We reserve the right to request the return of the unit at the end of the trial, which is expected to last until the end of 2019.

If you participate in the Beta test you agree to use the SonoPlus and report back on your experiences. You also agree that we can remotely access your SonoPlus device, for the sole purposes of monitoring its performance (including troubleshooting) and updating its software. **No** information of any kind is shared with any third party.

Thanks for your interest in the SonoPlus Beta trial.
